    <h1>HTML Mini-Project – About Me Page</h1>

    <p>
      This current project, “HTML Mini-Project – About Me Page,” requires me to
      create an About Me webpage and a README.md file that documents the steps I
      took and the process I followed.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>
      By completing it, I will have demonstrated stronger comfort using GitHub
      commands, creating and managing new repositories, and writing basic HTML
      to structure a simple webpage.
